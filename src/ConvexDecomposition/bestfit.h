// This routine was released in 'snippet' form
// by John W. Ratcliff mailto:jratcliff@infiniplex.net
// on March 22, 2006.
//
// This routine computes the 'best fit' plane equation to
// a set of input data points with an optional per vertex
// weighting component.
//
// The implementation for this was lifted directly from
// David Eberly's Magic Software implementation.

// computes the best fit plane to a collection of data points.
// returns the plane equation as A,B,C,D format. (Ax+By+Cz+D)
