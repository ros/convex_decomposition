// compute the 'best fit' oriented bounding box of an input point cloud by doing an exhaustive search.
// it spins the point cloud around searching for the minimal volume.  It keeps narrowing down until
// it fails to find a better fit.  The only dependency is on 'double_math'
//
// The inputs are:
//
//         vcount    : number of input vertices in the point cloud.
//         points    : a pointer to the first vertex.
//         pstride   : The stride between each point measured in bytes.
//
// The outputs are:
//
//         sides     : The length of the sides of the OBB as X, Y, Z distance.
//         matrix    : A pointer to a 4x4 matrix.  This will contain the 3x3 rotation and the translation component.
//         pos       : The center of the OBB
//         quat      : The orientation of the OBB expressed as quaternion in the form of X,Y,Z,W
